<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Paper

Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) has emerged as a key wearable haptic feedback technology capable of simulating a wide range of force feedback, such as the impact force of boxing punches, the weight of virtual objects, and the reaction force from pushing on a wall. To simulate these external forces, EMS stimulates the muscles that oppose (i.e. antagonistic to) the actual muscles that users activate, causing involuntary muscle contraction and haptic sensations that differ from real-world experiences. In this work, we propose Paired-EMS which simultaneously stimulates both the muscles that users activate and that prior EMS stimulates (i.e. antagonistic muscle pairs) to enhance the external force feedback experience. We first conducted a small formative study (n=8) to help design the stimulation intensity of muscle pairs, then conducted a user experience study to evaluate Paired-EMS vs. prior EMS approaches for both isometric and isotonic user actions. Study results (n=32) showed that Paired-EMS significantly improved realism, harmony, and entertainment (p<.05) with similar comfort (p>.36), and was overall preferred by 78% of participants (p<.01).

We used two channels of an FDA-approved, 4-channel EMS device (iSTIM EV-805) to generate safe and adjustable waveforms, and controlled the delivery to users using an Arduino Uno board with relay switches.

The tactile devices are worn by participants for the study. All 32 participants wore a vibrotactile sleeve to mask
out the tingling sensation caused by EMS. For tactile feedback on the fist and forearm, half of users used (A) a solenoid actuator
design based on pulling a rotating plate to hit the user; and the other half of users used (B) ERM-based vibrotactile band.

</div>

The distribution of user preference for baseline vs. Paired-EMS, for realism, harmony, entertainment, comfort, and overall preference when performing Blocking (isometric) and Punching (isotonic) actions for (A) a solenoid actuator based tactile feedback, and (B) ERM actuators based tactile feedback. Participants significantly preferred Paired-EMS for realism, harmony, entertainment, and overall with large effect sizes.
